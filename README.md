# Instagram Unfollow Bot

This project is an Instagram unfollow bot that automates the process of unfollowing users on Instagram. The bot uses Selenium to interact with the Instagram web interface and BeautifulSoup to parse an HTML file containing the list of usernames to unfollow.

# **IMPORTANT**

**You need to have the ITY.html file in the same directory as the python file. Instructions can be seen here:**
